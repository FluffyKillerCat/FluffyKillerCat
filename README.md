# Hello, I'm Joud H.


My focus is on **backend development** with **Python**, and I'm especially interested in building intelligent systems using modern AI tooling. I enjoy working on projects that combine software engineering with machine learning to create real-world value.

I attend tech conferences, follow AI research trends, and contribute to open source projects when I can.

##  Tech Skills
- **Primary Language:** Python
- **Focus Areas:** Backend systems, AI pipelines, data workflows
- **Tooling:** Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, OpenAI API, FastAPI, Celery, Redis, GraphQL
- **Workflow:** API design, data processing, and model integration

##  Current Interests
- AI integration in backend systems
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines
- Privacy-aware NLP (redaction, anonymization)
- Vector databases and embedding-based search

##  Projects
Explore my GitHub for experiments and projects — from document automation to AI-powered APIs.

##  Contact
Always happy to connect, collaborate, or exchange ideas about AI and backend development.
